# CodeWars Solutions
I like using easy problems from CodeWars to get used to working in a language. No matter if it's a language I've used for a couple of years like java or something newer to me like C# I think it is a good idea to solve some algorithms to get used to thinking in a particular language.

I'm currently adjusting back into Java and learning some C# occaisonally.
